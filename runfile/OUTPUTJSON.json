"review": "I enjoy the game play but it\u2019s untrue that you play against your own skill level and I check each match and have proof. Sometimes I play against others who are 5 times my skill level and sometimes I play against others who are so much lower on the skillz level than I am, I feel bad when I win. At first I thought it was just the practice games but it\u2019s the same when you play money games. I know that you take a gamble whenever you\u2019re playing for money but I think they should stand by their word of playing against your own skill level and that\u2019s not the case. But it\u2019s a gambling platform, I just don\u2019t appreciate the false advertising, call it like it is! And their so called algorithm platform is not realistic and I have my best friend who is a Statistician and Mathematician and she just laughs at their algorithm and refuses to join the app. You asked and offered and I tell it like it is but customer service is awesome as they follow up on requests immediately and are friendly and polite and that\u2019s a nice change but unless you\u2019re playing with money don\u2019t expect to win many tickets, it\u2019s 2 per practice game.",

"review": "Updated review. I previously gave this 3 star but am now updating to 5. The game is addicting, and while I am still convinced there are some unfair components to the game (sometimes you get matched with people who have way more experience than you - so basically you\u2019re very unlikely to win), it is NOT a Scam! I received my first check from them a week ago. Withdrawing an amount that is more than what you deposited takes a long time. Altogether, the entire process was about 2 months long. During these 1-2 months, I was so nervous and skeptical that it would never arrive. It took 2 weeks for them to verify my account, another 2 weeks to process my withdrawal, and then lastly another 3 weeks for the check to arrive in my mailbox. I have since made a second withdrawal and this time my withdrawal was processed in 2 weeks without requesting verification again, so the process is shorter after the first time. Additionally, I was offered an opportunity to sign up for direct deposit, so I am expecting the second withdrawal at a much faster rate. I am officially making money off this game (a sum much larger than I deposited and would have ever expected from a game). I Look forward to using this app in the future for more spending money, but beware it does get addicting and can easily eat up all the time In your day!",

"review": "I started using this app last week and have had more fun than I expected - it\u2019s quite addicting actually. I\u2019ve been practicing using their \u201cZ\u2019s\u201d, which you can earn free and play with for free. I wanted to get real good before starting to play with real money.\n\nHowever, last night I had an issue with the app freezing up and then giving me a bogus WIFI error message at the end of the game, after it showed my score, and was pending the next screen where it shows if I won or lost against my opponent. My wifi connection was great, even though this app said it wasn\u2019t working - I checked on another app of theirs and there was no WIFI issue there, so it was obviously a bug on this BINGO app. I contacted them right away, screenshots attached to show that it was pending and that the other persons score was lower than mine had been. They didn\u2019t respond until after the game \u201ctimed out\u201d and marked me as \u201caborting\u201d the game. I have spoke with several Skillz support people throughout the day, and although they happily credited me my pay-in amount, they refuse to pay my winnings, or give me credit for the league standings, experience points, etc. \n\nIf they won\u2019t give me my earned winnings on a free game, you better believe they wouldn\u2019t do it with real cash games. So sketch. I love this game, but won\u2019t be giving them a penny. I\u2019ll find another BINGO app to give my money to.",

"review": "This is a neat way to play Bingo!  The faster you daub, the more credit you get.  I like the practice feature of this app.  Of course you can play for money, if you don\u2019t mind making a deposit. You can win trophies for playing. The challenge is to not daub the wrong number.  You will be penalized.  The people at Skilz are all for player happiness. I have played enough for a Skillz sticker.  And because my address was entered incompletely, they sent me two stickers. How cool is that?! I am still having such a great time playing bingo this what way. I played so much I am developing a raw  area on my right wrist. It challenges me to move faster which is good. One issue I have with the game itself is waiting for my opponents score. There seems to be some lag here and I have to wait or just choose to move on to another game. But I keep coming back. So I guess I\u2019m having a good time.\n\nI keep coming back\n\nAlthough the app itself seems to put a big dent in my battery usage, I still enjoy the bingo.  The number display is quite large. So, due to a vison impairment, I have an easy time reading them, although the font style does cause confusion between 6\u2019s and 8\u2019s.    It\u2019s not enough to deter me.  BINGO on!",

I contacted their \u201csupport team\u201d and the responses I\u2019ve received are comical at this point\u2026.I couldn\u2019t have been more clear with them and they all respond with the same copied responses that have absolutely nothing to do with the 48 unauthorized charges. I\u2019ve went back and forth over 100 times in emails with an extremely thorough and basically dumbed down explanation because obviously they are not comprehending that somehow my card was used another 48 freaking times after I made 5 small deposits last month. To date I\u2019ve contacted their CEO, Founder, several others with higher titles at the company Skillz and yet no one will respond or address. I\u2019ve filled a complaint with the BBB, FTC and my local gaming commission. The amount of these charges are so high and just wrong to do to someone next step is my attorney. DO NOT USE THIS APP OR THIS UNETHICAL, ILLEGAL, THIEVING and downright disgusting company SKILLZ. Unless you want your information taken and used for unauthorized fraudulent transactions. No matter what it takes or what I have to do I am not stopping until they are brought to justice and refund the money that was stolen from me and probably several others.",

"review": "Playing with real money keeps it interesting and the fact that you can play with no money as well makes it easier on beginners like myself. I have started playing for real money though and at first I felt like I was just barely breaking even but I started spending a little more money to play in events and to play in the brackets and I\u2019ve won a few hundred already and have a check coming in the mail for my winnings I cashed out. I like that you can keep some of your winnings in the app and only have to cash out what you want to that way you still have money to play with. So far I have quite a few of the other SKillz games on my phone and I absolutely love playing all of them but this game in particular is my favorite. It has lots of other people playing at all times so it doesn\u2019t long for events and matches to finalize so that your account can be credited for your winnings. Give it a try but practice before you play any cash games because you\u2019d be surprised at how good some people are and might lose your money if your not prepared for a challenge. All in all I highly recommend this app",

"review": "First of all, yeah, this is gambling, and there\u2019s no transparency involved, which is sketchy. You have to trust that you\u2019re playing against other real people and that the game is matching you up fairly. If that\u2019s a problem, avoid. \n\nI toss in a few bucks here and there and manage to play for quite some time on it. Haven\u2019t won big enough to bother cashing out yet; I consider the small amount I\u2019ve deposited to be along the lines of paying for a game I enjoy. Fair enough.\n\nHowever, the tiered tournaments often move excruciatingly slowly. You have 24 hours to come back and play your next match each time you move up a tier, so one slow player can stretch out the game for DAYS, and no one can get their prizes until the whole thing\u2019s over. I get that people have to be given a fair amount of time to come back and play, but there has to be a better way. Maybe cut the return time from 24 hours to 12? Today is March 8 and I\u2019ve been stuck on round 4 of a $3 Blackout Battle waiting for an opponent since the 6th, and of course I can\u2019t start another $3 tournament until I place in the current one. It\u2019s too much waiting and dawdling for a $3 game. Seems counterintuitive to make players sit around and wait when they might otherwise throw in a little more money.",

I\u2019ve tried many times to win at least $5 but it didn\u2019t happen. If you are going to deposit the minimum amount which is $2 you can win atleast once in which is less than $1. Usually you win 60 cents because if you will play for $1 they will not give you the $1 dollar but 60 cents only because the 40 cents it will split into two for Blitz and Developer. I tried to deposit again $2 then $10 it sooo imposible to win evem just $5. I notice when I review the video of me and the opponent, we have the same card but they gave us different bingo number. Most of the time my opponent can fill the card bingo faster than I! Why? because they gave bingo numbers to them which is they have in their card. Most of the time i just got lower points even i tried to click faster \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22.

"review": "Many reviews state that this game is addicting. And, they\u2019re right! It is. But be careful, this game is very good at screwing you over without you noticing... I\u2019m still very skeptical of how truthful they are in stating that you\u2019re playing other members, as you only seem to win when you go extensive periods of time without playing; and even then, you never seem \u201callowed\u201d to win more than three or four times in a row before hitting a convenient losing streak shortly after. And even then the losses are almost always by crazy-small margins (I really lost by 10 points- several times in a row- once) And when you do win, they aren\u2019t consistent in distributing the correct amount of money you are supposed to win. \nFor example: if I play a match for $1 in winnings, and win that match, sometimes I win the whole pot ($1) sometimes I only win the amount I put towards the game (60\u00a2), sometimes it\u2019s just the amount my opponent put towards the game (40\u00a2). In the end, sometimes they cheat you out of your honesty-won money. So definitely play at your own risk and pay attention to your pot every time you play, especially if you win a match. Remember how much you had before you played the match so you can do the math afterwards if you win.",

I understand it\u2019s a business, but 40% of a dollar is pretty excessive in my opinion.  The game will let you win at first, but after that it becomes nearly impossible.  I just had three consecutive blackouts and lost all three games.  You\u2019re not actually playing an opponent in real time, you\u2019re actually playing someone\u2019s \u201creplay\u201d, so they are able to decide your oppositions score and determine the outcome of the game.  Personally, if I am playing an \u201copponent\u201d for money, then I\u2019d prefer to see the actual player.  This game gives you very little information aside whether you won or lost.  My recommendation is to not deposit your money, due to the game taking 40% right out of the gate and taking it amongst themselves to decide if you win or lose.  My suggestion is to play for \u201cz\u201d, the in game free currency.  Like I said, the game itself is fun, but I would refrain from putting your hard earned money into it.",
