So now we can play to our hearts content!! \nI remember there being a Monopoly in the App Store awhile ago and I absolutely loved it, but our iPad crashed and I couldn‚Äôt find another one until now. There is one thing that I loved about the old one that this new one doesn‚Äôt have and that‚Äôs is: while you are playing you could look and see how much % chance this certain lot would be landed on and by whom. For example, when I‚Äôm trying to build a house I‚Äôd look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I‚Äôd build the house on. (I hope that makes sense) Anyway that‚Äôs about the only thing I‚Äôd change! \nAnd by the way, I LOVE that you do not have to be connected to WiFi to play!!

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade.

Then I landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy ‚ÄúAdvance token to Boardwalk‚Äù. Now when I was a young boy I was told you‚Äôre supposed to put your card in another pile and shuffle them when they are all used up. Or you can keep them in rotation and place the card at the bottom. You guys need to fix this. Also I recommend creating more free tokens the options are extremely minimal. Other than that the game is excellent, no glitches, no freezing up.

I know you‚Äôre just trying to keep up with the trends to make kids get the app and it‚Äôs not such a bad thing (sales wise), but I have some literal critiques and ideas. \n\nIf you want to make people download your app, you have to listen to them. The only reviews currently on here are about how many ads play throughout the game and I do agree that having an ad after every round is tiring. But, If you changed the game to include less ads, the reviews won‚Äôt always talk about them therefore causing more people to get your game. I understand that you need the ads to make money but, seriously, they‚Äôre annoying. \n\nNow, the gameplay isn‚Äôt too bad and the graphics aren‚Äôt as bad as others but, it seems to get repetitive and boring. I know that it‚Äôs just a silly mobile game but, I still feel like mobile games should be fun. I know that my little cousin would love this game, so I‚Äôm sure it might be fun for others but, right now it just isn‚Äôt the best it could be. Though, I do enjoy that it‚Äôs not always the same thing like, sometimes you get to pop a fidget instead of trading the same things over and over again. But I have one question,, what does c*tting fruit have to do with fidgets? ü§î\n\n(TL;DR)\n In conclusion, this game isn‚Äôt the best but, I know some people would enjoy it.

As soon as I got in the app it immediately took me to fidget trading which is normal. The fidget trading part is actually pretty fun except they got a couple things wrong. The worth of different items in this app are not correct. For example you can trade an iPhone for a regular fidget or maybe two regular fidgets and that would be a good trade apparently or they might even not except that. That would just not make any sense. Also in one of the ads or in one of the pictures it says that the person got scammed which I never got in the game. Now onto the part I am most mad and disappointed about. After I completed the level it took me to different separate activities that weren‚Äôt even associated with the game. The game title is called fidget trading 3-D I think you all know that. But the game is very different from that. First it took me to popping fidgets which makes sense. It would make sense if that was like a bonus level every time you completed two fidget tradings except that was not the case.After that I got took in to a mini game were you slide your fake finger into a row of pop it‚Äôs. After that it took me to several more mini games before I got back to the actual fidget trading. If you don‚Äôt want ads you can turn off your Internet or service that‚Äôs what I did and I was OK. If they really wanted those mini games they could‚Äôve made a separate app instead of putting them into an app that is completely different than the mini games you‚Äôre supposed to play. As far as I know you cannot skip these mini games you have to play them before getting back to the actual game itself. If you were the owner or a worker reading this heres a few things I would change with the app.Delete the other mini games and just keep the fidget trading. I think more people would played your game if you did that also if you changed the Worth of different items in the app it would make more sense. All in all if you‚Äôre into different mini games revolving around fidgets or even just random games this game might be for you but if you‚Äôre looking into fidget trading app this is not for you I would  just search for a different app that involves fidget trading thank you very much for reading this long review goodbye.', 'date': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 16, 3, 14, 43)}, {'rating': 1, 'title': 'What do u do with the money', 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'boo stop', 'review': 'I have $209563 and what do I do with it', 'date': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 15, 17, 46, 48)}, {'rating': 4, 'title': 'One thing‚Ä¶', 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'sophie‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫üíï', 'review': 'Hello to the creator!I wanted to say this game is so amazing.But the only thing is that the ads!There are to many please put less ads it makes the game lass fun', 'date': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 15, 4, 59, 35)}, {'rating': 1, 'title': 'Sad', 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'bakebews', 'review': 'This game made me so sad and i got so sad and angry i poopied ): stuid game scam me and take all my money for me to only poop üò¢üò¢üò≠ü•∫üò∂\u200düå´Ô∏èüòìüò∂', 'date': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 13, 4, 24, 36)}, {'rating': 1, 'title': 'WHY JUST WHY!?!', 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'ellisahr234', 'review': 'THE AMOUT OF ADS IS UNPREDICTABLE!!!

Overall they provide you with 3 extra outfits, 3 extra avatars and 2 extra vehicles, at no extra charge. You may, however, be referring to the Fairytale Kingdom Collectables so, in order for me to address your concerns, I will also explain the "no micro transactions" part of our game\'s description, as well as clarify the presence of in-app purchases within the game. To begin with, when referring to micro-transactions we are speaking about those in-game transactions that require an in-game currency (for example, 1000 crystals to unlock an outfit), or that block you from playing the game until you have enough of a certain resource, which can be replenished by either making a purchase with real money or by waiting a few hours up to a day. This type of monetization is NOT present in The Game of Life 2. However, as is the case with all of our other digital board-game adaptations, The Game of Life 2 includes in-app purchases in the form of cosmetics, that gives players the option to change the look of their board and play-pieces. This is similar to how you can purchase the classic The Game of Life tabletop board-game or The Game of Life Simpsons edition. Our goal is to offer more visual choice to our players while still making it a choice. If we were to price The Game of Life 2 based on the total amount of development that was and will continue to be put into the new Worlds it would go well above its current sale price, and that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to the players who simply want the classic experience. To further clarify, purchasing the base game will give you access to the full game in terms of game-play functionality and features. You absolutely do not need to purchase anything else from the store in order to enjoy The Game of Life 2.\nRegardless, we appreciate your feedback and can see that the game\'s description regarding "no micro-transactions" may be confusing to players. We will make sure to edit the description in our next update to prevent further confusion.\nAs for your comparison to the original game, we are sorry to hear that The Game of Life 2 did not meet your expectations. We plan to develop this game for many years to come and very often implement the features most requested by our players, so please do not hesitate to let us how you think we may improve The Game of Life 2 - we would love to hear your thoughts!

We are always grateful to players who write us reviews clearly detailing how we can improve the game for them as it gives us the opportunity to perfect our games with every update!\n\nThe overall match length is definitely something that we are monitoring as there is still room for improvement. Quicker matches are useful for players who don't have a lot of time to play but that does mean that some actions may go unfulfilled (as you rightly pointed out), such as having children/pets and buying a house. A good compromise would be to have two game modes - one quicker and one slower - that players could choose from, but this would come at the expense of fragmenting our player-base in Online Multiplayer, leading to longer queue times.

I‚Äôve already played this more than I care to admit.  There are some personal issues, thought.  First of all, the games are often way too short.  On one hand, shorter games is good, since I can get in multiple quick rounds throughout my day.  On the flip-side, however, shorter games means that I often get to the end of the game with no additional family members (besides a spouse) and no houses, since it is far too easy to simply just roll past those events so they never come up.  I find myself wishing these events were much easier to trigger, especially because each of these adds to the Attributes you accumulate that affect your total score at the end of the game.  Speaking of additional family members, I was disappointed that when I finally got a game where I could get a pet, the game automatically chose a cat for me.  I don‚Äôt mind cats, but I am much more of a dog person.  The game touts itself as being all about ‚Äúchoice‚Äù, yet seems all too happy to randomly chose which pet you get with no player input. When I played another game, the A.I got a dog and I felt a little cheated. Yep.  I was jealous of a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù, if you can believe it.  In real life (which this game is meant to emulate!), choosing a pet is such a personal thing, that I would have liked to have been able to chose my own pet rather than have the game chose it for me.  You are able to chose your own spouse, why not be able to chose your own pet??  At the end of the day, however, these are really just nitpicks and my own personal issues that probably don‚Äôt really matter or affect much of anything else.  Overall, it‚Äôs still a pretty fun little game, even just playing against the A.I. : )'}, {'rating': 5, 'date': datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 15, 2, 30, 38), 'isEdited': False, 'developerResponse': {'id': 17309085, 'body': 'Hello and thank you so much for your kind review!

I have played with random people as well as friends so I can safely give a in-depth review of this game. First off, having kids in this game means nothing as it doesn‚Äôt provide any sort of benefit like it did in the first game. Getting married gets you 60/30K but the family route 10/10 is worse than getting a double payday by staying single. They just make up the fact the family route is lacking buy adding a single house buying space that is rarely landed on. Action spaces do not ever provide enough risk with it being player vs player as it‚Äôs merely a game of luck with the spinner when the 2nd option is usually a spinner for a 80/20k guarantee that you don‚Äôt have to give other players anything. The risk route isn‚Äôt a good route either, the risk for the reward is usually very low and not enough of a game changer to pull out a win. I personally think there should be more game modes, or more ways to play. For me, I don‚Äôt have the bundle pass, but my friends do and it‚Äôs day and night for the accomplishments you feel after a game. This game gets very stale after 5 games played, it‚Äôs hard to want to return because you end up going the same routes and never being encouraged to go different routes. Most games are won by landslide and I haven‚Äôt had a single game that was within 200 points. I like this game maybe once a month at most, there just isn‚Äôt much variety at all. Games don‚Äôt last that long, attributes are interesting but doesn‚Äôt make the game competitive much either. Choosing the best route guarentees a win 80% of the time no matter the rolls unless other players choose the same exact routes. Always pick college, into single, invest in the future, go back to college, safe path. These paths guarentee the most money and attributes and are way better than the other options. \n\nConclusion: it‚Äôs a fun game every once in a while to play 1 or 2 games with friends, but it leaves you consistently unsatisfied. I would rather play monopoly, uno, risk, or any other board game really than the game of life. For a sequel, this was very disappointing and doesn‚Äôt capitalize almost anything on the original game. I actually would probably rather play the first game because of the player v player mini games and having a family have benefit and that risky paths can change the outcome of games.', 'rating': 2, 'isEdited': False, 'developerResponse': {'id': 21974343, 'body': 'Hello and thank you kindly for your constructive feedback.

I just bout this game in a four pack for $9.99 and we started playing clue, then the game of life.  Love the games however, my kids noticed the Halloween themed game of life downloads.  I purchased the $5.99 pack, which gave extra map and costumes, cars, etc. told my kids and we all went to play again. Low and behold, only I had the content. I am so over these greedy apps that share the main game but expect me to pay 5.99 for each of my family (6 in total including me) to have the same features! Really? I felt so bad after starting the game, getting my kids excited to play the Halloween map and I was the only one who had the content while they could see I was in a different outfit and car, they had the same basic map.  Then find out even in clue, you have to pay for new maps if you don‚Äôt want the same boring one.  What a waste of money.  Nowhere does it state extra purchases wouldn‚Äôt be sheared and if I had known ahead of time it wouldn‚Äôt be shared and there was so much more in app purchases I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it in the first place.  If your already paying for a game, why be greedy and require more purchases.  I understand if it was free but come on! I am so irritated that not only can‚Äôt Apple keep their idea of family sharing, actually family sharing, including purchases, but that this game maker can‚Äôt allow their outrageous add on prices to be shared between family either and require a separate purchase for all members.  I could buy a new Xbox one game for the cost, and the extras weren‚Äôt even great for the amount.

I have to say it‚Äôs pretty good considering it‚Äôs still basically the game of life. \n\nFor anyone old enough to remember the Game of Life: Twists and Turns edition, this takes a lot from that. Not only is there money, but there are specific point pools for life, education, and investment. It makes it interesting if people are fighting to have the most in certain categories. The board also has a lot of split paths, such as get married or not. You can also choose pets over babies, which I like.\n\nYou can marry any kind of person you want too, which I thought was a good idea, and you can choose a house and I like how you actually hop around in the house. You have college and grad level jobs which is cool, and even spaces to increase your salary if you like your current job.\n\nMy only real complaint which took one star away was the extra board. I decided to get the VIP pass (the only game from this company I did that for). I like the graphics, the fact you can have more avatars, vehicles, and profile pics. You can have jobs relevant to the board, such as knight or jester for the fantasy board. The huge drawback is that the rest of the cards don't change. I‚Äôm dressed as an elf with the job of jester, and the first card I pick is ‚Äúfix your computer‚Äù. It really detracts from the feel of the entire board with the modern life cards.\n\nHonestly if the life cards matched the theme, I would highly recommend the VIP pass. The rest of the fantasy board was pretty fun and added fun role playing jokes as we went. Without the cards matching, I would say it‚Äôs up to you if you care or not to splurge on it.\n\nI‚Äôm playing on a new iPad Pro with iOS 13.5.1 and I haven‚Äôt seen any bugs yet.", 'title': 'It‚Äôs life...v2.0'}, {'rating': 5, 'userName': 'DIDDFIFFICRJF&F', 'isEdited': False, 'date': datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 17, 14, 6, 34), 'review': 'Omg I love this app!

Limited avatar, only one map and they make you pay 5 more bucks for like another lay out and some ridiculous 35 bucks for some bundle package. Game overall takes forever. Let alone multiplayer. They even fill with bots if not enough real players can be found. With that being said, they don‚Äôt even simulate or FF the bots turn which is ridiculous. Also, simple things that should hAve been input off the get-go (mini-map to see other players and overall score/$/skill things. No chat within players. Waited 20 seconds for one dude some turns for him to spin his ;$);&: wheel.) also needs some ranking system ur playing for nothing essentially. Also should input some other bonuses at end of game to shake score up instead of just money and most skills. If the devs see this, please refund me my money? Have some empathy. Corona virus n all. Thx.\n\nUPDATE- dev responses only to 5 star ratings LOL! The game is so boring. Every time I start playing I feel like ending it once you know all 4 players turn order. $3.99 though you‚Äôd expect a little something more lol an easily made copy from an old game yet in 2020 they are stiffing you for 4 bucks.

You‚Äôd think my first purchase for a game would have some excitement or even just anything but having to wait 5 minutes for your turn just to spin a wheel one time and land on getting taxed. Please please may I have a refund. I‚Äôve never played a worse game tbh so sorry but that‚Äôs fax no cap. Then they want to charge you money for avatars when purchase info states avatars. The game gives u 4 avatars and they are pretty lame. I‚Äôd take half my money back.

And unfortunately, the spinner usually hits high numbers no matter what you try‚Äîunless it will hurt you. Expect to get low numbers only if you‚Äôre headed for an auto stop, where it doesn‚Äôt matter what number you spin, or if your in competition with your computer opponent and high number wins money.  OH, it might give you a low number if it‚Äôll make you land on pay taxes, too.

If you can lose money to the computer opponent in a round you will 90% of the time. Land on fate?

Some might miss the Thunderdome-style player vs. player mini games & action card discussion topics, but the overhaul helps keep players interested over time.\n\nExtra kudos for the inclusion of a gender-neutral peg & their adorable wedding outfit.  It‚Äôs a great way to educate children about gender identity and/or the LGBTQ+ community in a no-big-deal way.  (Or you can just explain that pink + blue = purple.)\n\nAs much as I enjoy this game, there are a few things that are annoying enough to affect my rating:\n* In the Pass & Play mode, it would be nice to have the option of changing a peg‚Äôs name from Player2 etc.  (Kids, especially young ones and/or siblings, might care about this more than adults.)\n* The Fate square‚Äôs spinner is more about probability than fate.  Half of the spaces are occupied by Taxes and Actions, the two most common spaces on the rest of the board.  Without removing the Action spaces & dividing the spinner evenly between the remaining five big-ticket items, the only motivation to choose the Risky path is if you‚Äôre in dire need of a house or babies to complete your rewards puzzle.  Speaking of which...\n*THIRTY BABIES FOR AN AVATAR???  It‚Äôs beyond unreasonable.  There are five ‚Äúgrow your family‚Äù spaces on the entire board, all on the right-hand side.  Even with the 11 Fate spaces, a player has to follow a very specific & non-lucrative path to collect offspring, if they‚Äôre lucky enough to land on a space.  And I don‚Äôt know why the game‚Äôs description talks about having a dozen cats or five dogs, since the most I‚Äôve ever gotten was three.  I just finished this puzzle for the basic world, and it easily took over 50 games to get 30 kids/pets.  And those games were dedicated exclusively to the paths that had a family space on them, so it became tedious very quickly.  The avatar wasn‚Äôt any fancier than the others, either, so it was a huge disappointment.  I don‚Äôt recommend actively pursuing this reward unless Marmalade makes it easier to achieve (reduce the number required, add ‚Äú2nd chance‚Äù action cards, etc.).\n\nAlso, the career-choice code is a little screwy, because the card that is selected is removed (instead of staying on the screen) 99% of the time.  But that‚Äôs not a big deal, because it‚Äôs displayed on the map feature during each player‚Äôs turn.\n\nOverall, this is a great modern take on the game & I definitely recommend it.

I like how it‚Äôs been modernized with fun new ways to interact with the spinner, new games, and I greatly appreciate the inclusion of same-sex marriages and transgender character options.\n\nBut I do have a few minor things I noticed about the gameplay that I want to bring up.\n\n1. The boards are pretty short. It‚Äôs easy to end up flying through a game by rolling high and missing a lot of spaces. I‚Äôve played 5 games so far and I‚Äôve never seen anyone ‚Äî myself or one of four computer players ‚Äî have a child. Definitely recommend more spaces on the board.\n\n2. The attributes don‚Äôt seem very helpful when it comes to your final score unless you have the crown, and even then it seems more helpful to have a lot of money vs having crowns. Maybe weigh the attributes a bit more compared to cash so there‚Äôs a real incentive to go after them, especially since the Action space attributes can ask 100K from you? Or have all attribute cards have a cost to them, instead of just the 2-attribute ones?\n\n3. I think there should be a higher incentive to get married, or at least to weigh it evenly against staying single. Maybe once you‚Äôre married, every time you pass a salary space, your spouse adds a small amount to your paycheck (maybe 20K?). And you should definitely get 2 Happiness attributes from marriage instead of one. \n\n4. I‚Äôd like some negative events that aren‚Äôt taxes. Most of the action cards are positive ones, I‚Äôd like to see setbacks like totaling your car, emergency surgery, private schooling for your children, natural disaster property damage, divorce ‚Äî you could also add insurance like in the original game, where you have to pay a set amount every round but you can avoid some of the disaster cards for your car and house(s).\n\nThose are all the ideas I have for now, and if you do see them, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read them over.

The overall feel is very jerky. While they may have made the play faster, it feels much more like a computer game than it used to. The smoothness of moving the pieces around is much reduced. 2.

As another review stated, to reduce the number of sorting trays from a barely adequate four to a useless single tray is a strong indication that the developer doesn‚Äôt actually understand how users use the app. The idea of multiple sorting trays is that it allows a user to search through smaller subsets of pieces (based on shape or color, etc.) rather than through every unplaced piece of a puzzle. As I typically do puzzles with over 700 pieces, the four trays allow me to search through less than 200 pieces to find the one I‚Äôm looking for rather than four times that number. Also noted earlier is the less-functional background color button that now only works in one direction. If you advance too quickly you can overshoot the desired color and have to cycle through all of them again. And what is the benefit derived from these changes? A ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù aesthetic? If developers feel the need to tinker with an app which already has a 4.7/5 rating, then make it <more> user friendly, make it <more> functional, give users <more> options.

There is very little space around the outside of the puzzle to see extra pieces, and when you scatter pieces at the beginning they are almost completely off the screen. We need better control over the board size and orientation. When you select Full Size board and Large playing area, you cannot play in landscape mode.

But I honestly don\'t mind watching ads, if there were more puzzles to purchase with the coins. There used to be many puzzles you could buy with coins, and it was fun earning them through playing games and watching ads. Now there are only a few measly puzzles selling for coins in the "Treasure Box".  Really disappointing, and now I rarely watch the ads or play the games to earn coins.

When you first start the game you are confronted with its main screen that contains no less than 18 different icons which you can click on.

You are forced to move it again. This annoys me. I wish there was an option to turn this off.\n\n3. You earn coins at a very slow rate. You can unlock puzzle packs for thousands of coins, but be prepared for it to not be anytime soon. You literally only earn two or three queens per puzzle. I am nowhere near close to purchasing a puzzle pack. Having said that, my actual concern regarding the acquisition of coins is this; there are achievements, which I like. Generally, when playing any games that have objectives for you to complete, you receive a reward. There is no indication that you are receiving coins after an achievement is reached. No indication that you are receiving any reward whatsoever. So I am finishing puzzles left and right, yet as far as I can tell I have not received a single thing for doing so. You are able to watch an ad after finishing each puzzle in order to amass coins in this fashion. But I believe that is it.

I have to watch an ad before every game, and often during a game, so I highly doubt that you can‚Äôt find an ad somewhere. I do not have a credit card online, so at 6 credits a puzzle it will take months to buy a new puzzle pack. Your puzzle selection is wonderful, and I like the way they are set up to play, my only complaint is the credits. A few days ago, you said something new and exciting was coming, but nothing did.

However, for me, it could be improved. I have some color blindness and problems with spatial relationships.

Dark puzzles are tough as it‚Äôs hard to differentiate the dark blacks, blues, browns, greens, etc. from one another. Puzzles busy with a million items aren‚Äôt fun for me either. I like landscape pictures best. Just brighten them up. Give atmospheric foreboding a break. Forget ones where 75% of the picture is petals, fall leaves, etc. Too aggravating. Also, cut down on the space devoted to skies where there isn‚Äôt much going on. Even if the lower 1/2 is lovely, the tedium of working a sky with little to no variation just makes the puzzle a pass for me.\n\nOne thing that helps is being able to change the background/table color.

Things I like include - the daily puzzle; events; objectives to accomplish; earning coins to buy more puzzles; trays for pieces; and all the pieces on the board where I can see them.  \n\nAs with all apps, however, there are some issues and possible enhancements.   Coins - the app offers a chance for extra coins by watching an ad after you complete a puzzle (up to 500 coins).  However, somehow it never awards more than 10 or maybe 20 coins and regularly indicates no ads are available.  I can‚Äôt help but think the ‚Äúno ads available‚Äù occurs when the reward would have been a high amount of coins (yes, I‚Äôm likely paranoid).  \n\nObjectives - I was on the last one - complete a puzzle every day for 80 days and had 2 days left.  The app only counted the Clue event puzzles toward the objective and then failed to count the puzzle I completed, resetting the counter to 0.    Not at all a good thing!!!\n\nSuggestion - when the pieces are scattered on the board, it would be helpful if they were scattered so they don‚Äôt overlap.  I find I have to spend more time than I‚Äôd like spreading them out so I can see them all, especially when I‚Äôm doing the puzzles at 400 pieces.  \n\nOverall, though, this is by far the best jigsaw puzzle app I‚Äôve found.
